<h1> EventList Privacy Policy </h1>


<p> Welcome to EventList, the online and mobile service of EventList, LLC ("EventList," "we," or "us"). 
The Privacy Policy covers both our "online" (e.g., web and mobile services, including any web sites operated by us such as 
www.EventListApp.com, mobile applications, however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or 
otherwise) and "offline" (e.g., collection of data through mailings, telephone, or in person) activities owned, operated, 
provided, or made available by the EventList. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to EventList, 
and your choices about the collection and use of your information. BY USING OUR SERVICES OR BY OTHERWISE GIVING US YOUR INFORMATION, 
YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. </p>

<h3> 1.	How We Collect and Use Information </h3>

Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Use.
<p>We collect the following types of information about you: </p>

<ol>
	<li> <b>Information you provide us directly:</b> We may collect this information through various forms and in various places through the Services (collectively, "EventList App"), including account registration forms, contact us forms, or when you otherwise interact with us. When you sign up to use the EventList App, you create a user profile. We ask for certain information (some optional) such as your username, first and last name, birthdate, phone number, e-mail address, gender, Facebook ID number, and may also retain any messages you send through the EventList App, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the EventList App. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the EventList App, as is further described below.</li>
	<li> <b>Analytics information:</b> While we may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the services and viewing of our content, we do not share Personal Information with these analytics service providers, but they may set and access their own cookies, web beacons and embedded scripts on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including non-personally identifiable information. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the EventList App. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.</li>
	<li> <b>Cookies information:</b> When you visit the EventList App (either through a mobile device or online) we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your web browser and lets EventList help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the EventList App (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the EventList App), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the EventList App over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the EventList App may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</li>
	<li> <b>Log file information:</b> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the EventList App. When you use our EventList App, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the EventList App, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</li>
	<li> <b>Device identifiers:</b> When you access the EventList App by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers," such as a universally unique identifier ("UUID"). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by EventList. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the EventList App. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the EventList App. Some features of the EventList App may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</li>
	<li> <b>Location data:</b> When you access the EventList App by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store "location data," which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the EventList App. Some features of the EventList App, particularly location-based EventList Apps, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.</li>
	<li> <b>Clear gifs/web beacons information:</b> When you use the EventList App, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons), which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track, which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information is allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the EventList App.</li>
	<li> <b>Commercial and marketing communications:</b> We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. We also use your information to send you EventList App-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the EventList App, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of EventList App-related e-mails.</li>
	<li> <b>Use of certain EventList App type information we collect about you:</b> We use or may use cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our EventList App; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; (g) to provide advertising to your browser or device, and (h) automatically update the EventList application on your mobile devices; but again, we do not collect UDID information.</li>

<h3>3.	How We Store and Protect Your Information</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Storage and Processing: Your information collected through the EventList App may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which EventList or its subsidiaries, affiliates or Service providers maintain facilities. EventList may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which EventList or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or EventList App providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
	<li>Keeping your information safe: EventList cares about the security of your information, and uses commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the EventList App. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from EventList, at all times. We only send your Facebook identification token once via the Internet and therefore is not stored on the device. However, EventList cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to EventList or guarantee that information on the EventList App may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of third party sites and EventList Apps that you add to the EventList App, such as social networks. EventList is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party. We work to protect EventList and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold.

<h3>6.  Additional Information Regarding Video Content Posting</h3>
<p>1.

You should understand that users who see the content you provide can always save it using any number of techniques: screenshots, in-app functionality, or any other image-capture technology. It’s also possible, as with any digital information, that someone might be able to access messages forensically or find them in a device’s temporary storage. Keep in mind that, we cannot promise that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe. And we may need to suspend those deletion practices if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve content or if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations.</p>
